# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis
## Overview
The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset is a widely used dataset for exploring machine learning techniques and statistical analysis related to diabetes prediction.
This project analyzes the dataset to identify patterns and factors contributing to diabetes, leveraging data science tools and techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains medical and demographic data collected from Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, living near Phoenix, Arizona. 
The primary goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## Features
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (2 hours after a glucose tolerance test).
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age in years.
Outcome: Binary (0 or 1), indicating whether diabetes is present (1) or not (0).

# Project Objectives
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand feature distributions and correlations using Histogram and Correlation Matrix.
Identify missing or inconsistent values.

## Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing data.
Normalize or standardize features for better model performance.

## Modeling:
Develop machine learning models to predict diabetes.
Compare model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Insights:
Identify the most important factors influencing diabetes prediction.
Provide actionable recommendations for healthcare professionals.
